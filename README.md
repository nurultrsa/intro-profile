# ABOUT ME
Hi! My name is Nurul Trisna Aulya. I never consider myself as a science-oriented person but I enjoy the adrenaline in learning something new. Fyi, I'm a web development and UI/UX Design enthusiast. I spend my time tweaking things up, taking notes, and reading. Most importantly, I love animals. 

# WHAT I'M UP TO
* I'm currently taking a digital innovation bootcamp through Kampus Merdeka program under Kemendikbudristek.
* Planning at least do 2-3 projects/month.
* One I day I hope to : get a job at unicorn company as a developer or any related to UIX, travel to many countries, own a ton of cats.
